  <div id="a">The W3C's goal is to create technical standards and guidelines for web technologies worldwide. These standards are intended to keep a consistent level of technical quality and compatibility concerning the World Wide Web. Developers who create web applications can have confidence in the tools they're using, as web applications using these standards have been vetted by experts. An example of a W3C standard is web browsers. Most use W3C standards, which enables them to interpret code such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).</div>
